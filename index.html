              1. Human activity recognition using K-NN algorithm Machine
              Learning
            </dt>
            <dd>
              This project involves classifying activities from sensor data.
              K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors) assigns labels to instances based on
              proximity to labeled data points. In this context, it analyzes
              sensor data like accelerometers to recognize activities like
              walking, running, or sitting. The K-NN algorithm provides a simple
              yet effective approach for activity recognition, Coding in MATLAB
              is utilized to identify an image from a video using the K-NN
              classifier Machine Learning.
            </dd>
            <dt>2. Data Visualization with Python Libraries</dt>
            <dd>
              This project focuses on creating insightful and visually appealing
              representations of data. Python libraries like Matplotlib,
              Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy and Plotly are utilized to generate charts,
              graphs, and interactive plots from various datasets. This project
              enhances data comprehension and facilitates data-driven
              decision-making.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              3. Design of logically obfuscated 32-bit ALU using majority gates
              to Enhanced Security
            </dt>
            <dd>
              The design of a logically obfuscated 32-bit ALU using majority
              gates aims to enhance security by concealing its functionality
              from potential attackers. Majority gates utilize a threshold-based
              logic approach where the output depends on the majority of inputs.
              The key benefit of this project is that it reduces power and
              latency, and the Verilog coding is performed in Xilinx.
